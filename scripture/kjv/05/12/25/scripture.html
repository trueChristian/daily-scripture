<strong>Romans 14:2-4</strong><br />
2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. 3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. 4 Who art thou that judgest another manâ€™s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.<br /><br />
