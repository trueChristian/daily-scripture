<strong>Luke 20:46-47</strong><br />
46 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; 47 Which devour widowsâ€™ houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation. <br /><br />
