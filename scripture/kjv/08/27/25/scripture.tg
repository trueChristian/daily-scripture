<strong>Psalms 50:20-22</strong>
20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own motherâ€™s son. 21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. 22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.
