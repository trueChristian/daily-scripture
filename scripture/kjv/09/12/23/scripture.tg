<strong>Daniel 3:29</strong>
29 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedâ€“nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
